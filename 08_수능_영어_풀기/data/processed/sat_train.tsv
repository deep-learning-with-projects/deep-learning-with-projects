Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive, so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature.	1	2019	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	0
It also is part of the process of selection by which biological evolution functions.	1	2019	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	1
Starvation helps filter out those less fit to survive, those less resourceful in finding food for themselves and their young.	1	2019	9월	29	다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?	2
